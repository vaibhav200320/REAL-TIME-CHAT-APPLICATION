*DESCRIPTION* : CODTECH MERN Stack Internship: Task Description
This internship is a rigorous and highly practical program focusing on the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), demanding the successful completion of four mandatory, real-world development tasks before the stated deadline. Participants must submit all four tasks to be eligible for the Completion Certificate, which will be issued on the internship end date. The tasks are designed to test your ability to integrate front-end, back-end, and real-time communication technologies.

Task 1: Real-Time Chat Application
This foundational task focuses on real-time, bidirectional communication. You will build a fully functional chat application using React for the front-end user interface and Socket.IO for the back-end communication layer running on Node.js/Express.

The core challenge is establishing and managing persistent, low-latency connections between all users. The application must instantly broadcast a message from one user to all others. While not explicitly required, integrating a database like MongoDB to store message history would significantly enhance the deliverable, allowing users to view past conversations upon connecting. The final deliverable is a working chat application with live messaging capabilities, proving your command over WebSockets.

Task 2: Weather Application
This task centers on public API integration and creating a responsive, data-driven front end. Your goal is to build a web application that accurately fetches and displays current weather data.

The application must be integrated with the OpenWeatherMap API. You'll need to handle API key management, make asynchronous requests (e.g., using fetch or axios), and gracefully handle the resulting JSON data. The React front end must present the data—like temperature, humidity, and weather conditions—in a clear, responsive layout that adapts seamlessly to both mobile and desktop screens. This task validates your ability to consume external services and manage state in a React application.

Task 3: Real-Time Collaboration Tool
This task elevates your understanding of real-time synchronization beyond simple messaging. You are required to build a collaboration tool, such as a shared document editor or an interactive whiteboard.

The primary technology here is WebSockets (which can be implemented with Socket.IO). The challenge is maintaining a single, consistent state (the document or the drawing canvas) across multiple connected users. When one user makes an edit, that change must be instantly transmitted to and applied by all other clients, ensuring all users see the exact same content simultaneously. The deliverable is a live, synchronized tool with robust multi-user support, demonstrating advanced real-time data management.

Task 4: Productivity Tracker Chrome Extension
This is the most complex task, requiring a blend of browser-specific programming and the full MERN Stack for data persistence. You will develop a Chrome Extension designed for productivity management.

The extension’s client-side logic (using Chrome APIs in the background script) must monitor time spent on various websites and enforce boundaries by blocking designated distracting sites. Crucially, the MERN stack provides the backend infrastructure:

Express/Node.js handles the API endpoints.

MongoDB stores user preferences (like the blocked sites list) and the historical productivity data collected by the extension.

The system must generate and sync daily productivity reports across devices, leveraging the full power of the MERN stack for robust data management and reporting.
